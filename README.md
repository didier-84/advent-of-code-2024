# Advent of Code 2024

Here is my take on the daily puzzles of the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

This year I'm solving the puzzled in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/).

My solutions can be run in a terminal.

## How to run the challenges

With Lua installed on your machine, just run the following in your terminal:

```bash
# Run with the test input values
lua day-01/part-1.lua test
lua day-01/part-2.lua test

lua day-02/part-1.lua test
lua day-02/part-2.lua test

...

# Run with the real input values
lua day-01/part-1.lua
lua day-01/part-2.lua

lua day-02/part-1.lua
lua day-02/part-2.lua

...
```

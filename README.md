# Advent of Code 2024

Here is my take on the daily challenges of the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

I've chosen to solve the challenges in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/); my solutions can be run in a terminal.

## How to run the challenges

With Lua installed on your machine, just run the following in your terminal:

```bash
# Run with the test input values
lua day-01/part-1.lua test
lua day-01/part-2.lua test

lua day-02/part-1.lua test
lua day-02/part-2.lua test

...

# Run with the real input values
lua day-01/part-1.lua
lua day-01/part-2.lua

lua day-02/part-1.lua
lua day-02/part-2.lua

...
```

## Progress

| Day | Part 1 | Part 2 |
| ---| :-: | :-: |
| 01 | ✅ | ✅ |
| 02 | ✅ | ✅ |
| 03 | ✅ |    |
